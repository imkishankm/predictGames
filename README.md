## ‚öôÔ∏è Performance Optimizations -

To ensure smooth performance with large datasets (10,000+ items), the following optimizations are implemented:

- useCallback: Prevents unnecessary re-renders of components.

- React.memo: Optimizes functional components by avoiding re-renders when props haven't changed.

- Modular and Maintainable Code: Clean separation of logic and UI for scalability.

- Used react reanimated library for smooth animation

- Used FlatList to render large data for better user experiance.


## üì≤ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sports-prediction-app.git
cd sports-prediction-app

# Getting Started

## Step 1: Start Metro

```sh
# Using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn
```

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.
